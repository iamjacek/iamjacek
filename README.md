### Hello there 👋 I am Jacek!

👨🏻‍💻   I am self taught front-end dev. I like to use react and node.js. I am also interested in UI/UX just to draw some wireframe and do simple UI. I belive it will help all frontend scene to better understand and finally build our products!

- 🔭   I’m constantly trying to improve myself - every day!

- 🌱   I’m always keen to look into new tech and frameworks

- 🌍   Check my **[portfolio website](https://www.jacekwitucki.com)** to find more about me.

- ✍🏻   Except of frondend sometimes I need to write two line of backend and do some design **[dribbble](https://dribbble.com/iamjacek)**.

- 🗂   Some github stats:
