### Hello there 👋 I am Jacek!

👨🏻‍💻   I am self taught front-end dev. I like to use react and node.js technologies. I am also interested in web design just to draw some wireframe and do simple UI.

- 🔭   I’m still trying to improve on react and node.js.

- 🌱   I’m always looking to get to know new tech and frameworks.

- 🌍   Check my **[portfolio website](https://www.jacekwitucki.com)** to find more about me.

- ✍🏻   Not much but some of my design can be found on **[dribbble](https://dribbble.com/iamjacek)**.

- 🗂   Some github stats:
