### Hello theren my name is Jacek 👋

👨🏻‍💻   I am self taught front-end dev. I like to use react and node.js. I am also interested in UI/UX just to draw some wireframe and do simple UI. I belive it will help all of the frontend developers to better understand and build our products!

- 🔭   I’m constantly trying to improve myself - every day!

- 🌱   I’m always keen to look into new tech and frameworks!

- 🌍   Check my **[portfolio website](https://www.jacekwitucki.com)** to find more about me.

- ✍🏻   Except of frontend sometimes I need to write two line of backend and do some design **[dribbble](https://dribbble.com/iamjacek)**.

- 🗂   Some github stats:

- I enjoy activities such as swimming 🏊‍♂️ and gym exercise 🏋 
- In a free time I like to read a book 📚 or play some video games 🕹
